# Objective:
1. Replicate an experiment, understand when to use the algorithm
   using the default data given in https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders.
2. Prototype that covers 0-3 stages of a typical
   recommendation workflow
   (https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/tree/master/notebooks ). Create or
   modify notebooks to customize the four stages (0-3) for your recommender using
   the examples provided in
   https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders/tree/master/notebooks
3. Propose a sample schema of the data needed for building
   a snack recommendation system. Create a sample dataset in csv format and
   illustrate how your recommender can be used for that dataset. You can be as
   creative as you want. You can also use python packages like Faker to create a
   dataset. Also check out Kaggleâ€™s datasets if you can use any of the existing datasets
   as a proxy.
